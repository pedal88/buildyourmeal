        "content": "## Introduction\n\nGood knife skills are the most important tools in a cook's arsenal. They make cooking faster, safer, and more enjoyable. Uniform cuts ensure even cooking and better presentation.\n\n### The Grip\n\nHold the knife by gripping the blade with your thumb and index finger (the pinch grip) rather than just holding the handle. This gives you more control.\n\n### The Claw\n\nSafety first! Curl your fingertips under like a claw when holding the food to protect them from the blade.\n\n### Basic Cuts\n\n1. **Julienne**: Fine matchsticks.\n2. **Brunoise**: Tiny cubes made from julienne.\n3. **Chiffonade**: Fine ribbons of leafy greens.\n\nPractice with soft vegetables like celery or onions before moving to harder ones."

        "content": "## Beyond Salty\n\nSalt (NaCl) acts as a flavor magnifier using two mechanisms:\n1. It reduces water activity, concentrating flavors.\n2. It suppresses our perception of bitterness, allowing sweetness and sourness to shine.\n\n### Types of Salt\n\n* **Table Salt**: Fine grain, often iodized. Good for baking, bad for finishing.\n* **Kosher Salt**: Flaky, easy to pinch. The chef's standard.\n* **Sea Salt**: Expensive, crunchy. Use for finishing only.\n\n### When to Salt\n\nSalting meat early (dry brining) allows salt to denature proteins and retain moisture."

Shred cabbage.\n2. Massage with salt until liquid releases.\n3. Pack into a jar, submerged under liquid.\n4. Wait 1-2 weeks.\n\nThe lactobacillus bacteria naturally present on the cabbage digest sugars and produce lactic acid, preserving the cabbage and creating that signature tang."
